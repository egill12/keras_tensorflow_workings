# keras_tensorflow_workings
Code to create ML models and run analysis using ANNs etc
The file collects the normalised versions of each curreny data, using meaures of price based 
data only.
This NN file uses a LSTM (the lookback again is of interest, do we need to vary these?)
Should we standardise the time zone changes? Apply entropy on the model returns? 
Test on randomly generated data, use the valuation, eco trends, risk aversion etc to 
see if there is any interesting patterns there which allow us to understand the model behaviour?
